PDF OCR Stress Test

Paragraph Stress Test

Continuous prose with mixed punctuation: “Edge-aware OCR systems must balance recall
and precision; however, noise—especially from compressed scans—can create artifacts.” The
quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. A second paragraph repeats with minor edits to
detect hallucination: the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog, but this time the fox
pauses at line breaks to test robustness.

Code Fragment

Verbatim text can challenge OCR because of monospaced glyphs:
for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
double w = exp(-0.5 * pow(i - 2.0, 2));
printf("w[%d] = %.3f\n", i, w);
}

Conclusion

This concludes the synthetic PDF. Inspect the extracted text for dropped symbols, merged
lines, and mis-ordered sections. Compare the OCR output with the known ground truth
here to quantify accuracy.
