Abstract
This document intentionally mixes plain text, mathematical notation, tables, lists,
vector drawings, and hyperlinks. It is meant to probe how well the OCR pipeline
handles varied layouts, line breaks, and semantic structure.

Overview

The following sections combine narrative text with display math and inline symbols such as
⃗ = ρ/ε0 , and probability notation P(X ≤ x). Paragraphs use hyphenation
E = mc2 , ∇ · E
and line wraps to stress layout-aware OCR. Repeated words with subtle differences (e.g.,
kernel vs. kernels) are present to spot hallucinations.
